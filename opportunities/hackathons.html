      <h1>HACKATHONS</h1>
      <p>
        Hackathons are a great way to learn new skills, network with other
        hackers and mentors, and use what you've learned to build a project on
        something you're passionate about! In recent years, there has been a
        rise in hackathons specifically meant for women and non-binary students.
        Here are some awesome ones you should consider participating in.

          <h1>Pearl Hacks</h1>
          <p>
            Pearl Hacks is a hackathon targeted towards women and non-binary
            college students. The best part is you don't need any coding
            experience to participate! There are many opportunities to get to
            know other participants and form teams, and there are a variety of
            roles which are non-coding focused, such as design or management. If
            you <em>are</em> interested in learning how to code or improving
            your coding skills, there are tons of workshops which participants
            have the opportunity to attend, both in-person and virtually.
