      <h1>SCHOLARSHIPS</h1>
      <p>
      Not everyone has the privilege of attending an expensive university or bootcamp in order to get a job in
        tech. Financial issues should never be the reason someone is unable to enter this field.
        There are a variety of financial aid resources specifically for underrepresented genders in tech! Here are a few
        to get you started.

          <p>
            If you are a woman or non-binary individual in high school and need financial assistance to attend college, the Women at Microsoft
            Scholarship might be for you. Applications are open to high school seniors who want to pursue a career
            in STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math). While your intended major doesn't have to be
            computer science, the scholarship is focused on enabling young women and non-binary people to pursue
            a career in technology. Winners will receive a $5,000 award which they may be able to renew for up to four consecutive years.

          <h1>Women Take Tech</h1>
          <p>
            If a bootcamp seems more appealing or likely than college, don't worry! Plenty of bootcamps still have 
            scholarships for women and non-binary people trying to break into tech. The Women Take Tech Scholarship by 
            Flatiron School is a great example. Winners will have between $1,000 and $3,000 of their tuition covered,
            with the possibility of additional grants for those who are low-income. Around 75 women will be awarded
            this scholarship a year. Applicants must be at least 18 years old.
