        <h1>CODING BASICS</h1>
        <p>
          Trying to learn some coding basics but not sure where to start? We've
          got you covered. Here's a brief rundown of a few different Computer
          Science concepts used across many languages.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <br>
    
    <h2>Variables and Constants</h2>

    <p class="body-text">
      Variables and constants in programming are a lot like variables and
      constants in math; that is, a variable is a value that can change based on
      conditions within a program and constants are values that should not
      change regardless of the conditions in a program. Variables are used to
      store values which can be used for performing operations or otherwise
      manipulating data. A variable is essentially a "pointer" where the name
      (say, x, for example) "points" to a value (for example, the integer 1).
      Variables are different from constants in that, as the same suggests, they
      vary. This means that just because x equals 1 now, doesn't mean it will
      equal 1 later. In fact, the reason variables are often used is because
      their values will change as the conditions of the program change, allowing
      for new data or information to arise.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h2>Data Types</h2>

    <p class="body-text">
      A data type is an attribute of data which specifies how the data is
      intedended to be used. There are two main categories of data types: value
      types and reference types. Value types include integers, floats (imprecise
      decimal), doubles (more precise decimal), booleans (true or false value),
      and other types that merely store a value. Reference types, on the other
      hand, reference data that is stored elsewhere. What exactly is being
      referenced can get a bit complicated, so let's keep it simple: anything
      that's not simply storing a value is a reference type. This might include
      a string like "hello world" or an array (which we'll talk a bit more about
      later). Essentially, these data types define more complex structures which
      we can use to store more complex data. This brings us to data structures.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h2>Data Structures</h2>

    <p class="body-text">
      Data structures offer a specialized method of organizing and storing data
      in a way that allows us to perform operations on said data more easily.
      Some common data structures are arrays, linked lists, and hashmaps.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
      An array is a collection of items stored one after the other at a
      particular location in memory. It allows you to store many items of the
      same type together, such as test scores or race times. The items in an
      array need not be ordered, but each element will be identified by its
      particular "index" or position within the array.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
      A linked list is a linear data structure in which each data point or
      "node" points to the next node. Each node contains both its own data and a
      reference to the next node, or to null if there is no next node. Linked
      lists can be used to represent data that "chains" or data in which it is
      important to store both the current value and a reference to the next
      value. This concept can be applied to other, more complex data structures
      as well.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
      Hashing is a technique used for mapping keys and values into a hash table
      by using a hash function. Thus, a hash map is a data structure that maps
      unique keys to values as a way to group data. HashMaps or Maps are
      sometimes considered more versatile than arrays, as they are not
      inherently constrained by order and any value can be recalled by its key
      without knowing the index of that value. Alternatively, HashMaps tend to
      take up more "overhead" or space in memory, as they are not always as
      efficient as other data structures.
    </p>
    
    <br>

    <h2>Conditionals</h2>

    <p class="body-text">
      Conditionals, also referred to as "if-else" statements, are programming
      commands used for handling decisions. The explanation for how this works
      follows the name; "If something is true, then do this. If not, do
      something else." Conditionals are used with boolean or true and false
      values to evaluate data and initiate a specific process based on the
      characteristics of that data. For example, I might say "If you made above
      a 60% on your test, say 'You passed :)' else say, 'You failed :('". The
      idea behind the conditional is we can parse through various cases or
      situations in our code without having to write a different function for
      every situation and make decisions on which should be called by ourself.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h2>Loops</h2>

    <p class="body-text">
      A loop is a structure that repeats through a sequence of instructions
      until a particular condition is met. A common method of looping is a
      "while" loop, which essentially says "while a condition is happening, loop
      over this section of code." This allows for a set of code to be repeated
      until some state of the program changes. For example, I might say "while
      my-favorite-team = winning, repeat 'go team!'" In this case, I would only
      stop repeating "go team" when my team started losing. Alternatively, if I
      said "while the sky is blue, spin in a circle," you'd be spinning forever.
      This is known as an infinite loop, and is generally avoided in programming
      as it has no termination state. Another type of loop is a "for" loop which
      iterates over a specific set of data until each datapoint is visited. For
      example, I could say "for each person reading this, say 'stay awesome!'"
      and "stay awesome" would repeat until it was said for every person reading
      this. Loops can be used for a variety of purposes and are a vital part of
      creating efficient and effective algorithms.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h2>Functions</h2>

    <p class="body-text">
      Functions are self-contained sections of code that aim to accomplish a
      particular task. Most functions accept some data as a parameter and return
      something as a result. Functions can be "called" from the inside of other
      functions, meaning you could use a function many times with many sets of
      data and continue to receive new data. You might think of a programming
      function like a math function; in math, an x value goes in, and a y value
      comes out. Likewise, with a programming function, a parameter goes in, and
      a return statement comes out.
