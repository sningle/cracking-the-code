        <h1>CHOOSING A LANGUAGE</h1>
        <p>
          With so many to choose from, it's difficult to choose a programming
          language to begin your coding journey. If you're not sure where to
          start, here's a rundown of some of the most common beginner coding
          languages and what they're used for.

    <h2>What's a programming language and why are there so many?</h2>

    <p class="body-text">
      In essence, a programming language is a set of rules that converts
      instructions into machine code. Programming languages are the primary way
      of communicating with computers and allow programmers to easily implement
      algorithms without the complex syntax of lower-level languages such as
      assembly or machine code. There are multiple reasons so many programming
      languages exist, but the main one is that many of them are useful for
      different projects or methods of programming. For example, HTML, CSS, and
      JavaScript are commonly used for web-based projects. If you wanted to
      create a complex software algorithm, however, a language like Java, C++ or
      C might be more useful. This difference in usage in addition to variance
      in readability accounts for many of the preferences programmers have for
      particular languages. But which should you learn and why? Well, let's
      start with the basics.
    </p>
    
    <br>

    <h2>Common Beginner Coding Languages</h2>

    <p class="body-text">
      Some of the most common "first languages" of programmers globally are
      Python, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. Python is often taught from a software
      engineering perspective, focusing on objects and the way those objects
      interact to create algorithms to solve problems. The skills learned in
      using Python are more easily translated to languages like Java, C++, C,
      and other object-oriented languages. JavaScript as well as HTML/CSS, on
      the other hand, are better for web development specifically while still
      being relatively user friendly. These languages prepare programmers to
      continue expanding into other web development possibilities and, in the
      case of JavaScript, can still allow for some algorithmic practice. One big
      difference between Python and JavaScript/HTML/CSS is that Python generally
      requires an Integrated Development Environment or IDE, while the others
      can theoretically be written with simply a text document and a browser.
      This means web development languages may be more accessible in situations
      where downloading an IDE is not accessible. If one does wish to download
      an IDE, however, Visual Studio Code (also known as VSCode), Intellij, and
      Eclipse are common free IDEs which support Python. These IDEs can also be
      used for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS if a user would like to use a GUI to
      develop their code.
    </p>
    
    <br>

    <h2>Why use an IDE?</h2>

    <p class="body-text">
      Integrated Development Environments, or IDEs are great tools for beginner
      programmers and seasoned software developers alike. IDEs have automatic
      code-checking features, similar to Microsoft Word's "spellcheck." If there
      is a compiling error in your code (generally known as a syntax error),
      your IDE will likely point it out to you and suggest a way to fix it.
      Likewise, if there is a run-time error with your code (a deeper issue with
      the code itself), it will give you a stack trace describing exactly what
      went wrong and where it happened. This information is incredibly valuable
      and can save programmers a lot of time when it comes to debugging their
      code. Additionally, most IDEs include "debuggers," which allow users to
      run through their code line by line and view exactly what's happening
      "under the hood" of their program. IDEs also make file organization,
      adding dependencies, and cloning repositories significantly easier through
      a GUI or Graphical User Interface that allows users to easily navigate
      their code.
