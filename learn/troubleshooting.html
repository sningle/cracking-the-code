        <h1>TROUBLESHOOTING</h1>
        <p>
          A common experience of beginners and seasoned programmers alike is
          running into bugs in your code. What do you do when you hit a
          roadblock in your coding? We're here to let you know some of the best
          and most-used options.

    <h2>Method 1: Debugger</h2>

    <p class="body-text">
      One of the most common ways of resolving errors in your code is using a
      debugger in an Integrated Development Environment, or IDE. IDE's commonly
      have debug features (often denoted by a bug icon) that allow users to run
      through their code step by step to see exactly what is happening at each
      line. The first step to debugging is setting breakpoints, which indicate
      where you will begin debugging and where the program can stop debugging.
      Often your debugger will only show you the processes contained within the
      breakpoints you set, so ensure that your breakpoints contain enough of
      your code to troubleshoot your issue. Likewise, you probably don't need to
      include all your code within your breakpoints. It's good practice to try
      to pinpoint the problem as much as possible before using a debugger to
      save time and better understand what issue you're having. Once the proper
      breakpoints are set, you can begin debugging by selecting the debug icon.
      Your IDE will then compile your code and begin at the first line of your
      code, logging each variable instantiated as you "step over" each line of
      code. Going through each line in this manner should help you see exactly
      what's happening in your code so you can fix it. It's worth noting that a
      debugger is merely a tool to help programmers figure out what's wrong with
      their code, not a program to fix the code itself. While a debugger may
      help you figure out an issue, it will not tell you what issue your code is
      having or change your code in any way.
    </p>

    <h2>Method 2: Documentation</h2>

    <p class="body-text">
      Sometimes programmers run into issues that aren't simply an error with
      their code, but rather an issue figuring out how to proceed with writing
      their code in a way that will produce the results they want. In this case,
      reading the documentation for the language, package, library, or function
      you're trying to use may be helpful. The official documentation for each
      of these generally describes the usage of each parameter, method, or
      function it uses. These descriptions will typically explain how each
      component is meant to be used as well as additional connected components
      or attributes that may be of use to the programmer. Reading through this
      documentation can be difficult, as often it is very technical in nature,
      but it can help a programmer better understand how the code itself works
      and thus allow them to write better code.
    </p>

    <h2>Method 3: Third-Party Websites</h2>

    <p class="body-text">
      If all else fails, chances are someone has had the same issue as you at
      some point in time. Simply Googling your question or error may result in
      forum posts detailing a similar problem in which the solution to their
      problem is useful for solving your own problem. Common websites for this
      purpose are StackOverflow and GeeksForGeeks. StackOverflow is a
      forum-style website that allows programmers to connect with other
      experienced programmers to troubleshoot issues that arise while coding. If
      your question is not already answered somewhere on the website, you have
      the ability to post your question so that other programmers can respond.
      Learning from other programmers is an incredibly valueable tool in
      learning to code and should be utilized whenever possible. Additionally,
      websites like GeeksForGeeks offer practice problems, tutorials, and
      explanatory articles on a wide variety of Computer Science topics. If
      you're trying to accomplish a more general programming task, it's possible
      you can find an explanation for how to do it on GeeksForGeeks. If not,
      often there will be similar explanations and problems that may help you
      better understand how to solve your issue.
