          CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets with an emphasis placed on “Style.” 
          While HTML is used to structure a web document (defining things like headlines and paragraphs, 
          and allowing you to embed images, video, and other media), CSS comes through and specifies 
          your document’s style—page layouts, colors, and fonts are all determined with CSS. 
          Think of HTML as the foundation, and CSS as the aesthetic choices.
